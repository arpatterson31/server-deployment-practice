## Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

Application development in the Node.js ecosystem, including the writing of modular code using CommonJS modules, writing tests to assert code quality, setting up and working in a "Continuous Integration"  environment (Github Actions).

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define
